## Goals

Web application security is difficult to learn and practice. Not many people have full blown web applications like 
online book stores or online banks that can be used to scan for vulnerabilities. In addition, security professionals 
frequently need to test tools against a platform known to be vulnerable to ensure that they perform as advertised. 
All of this needs to happen in a safe and legal environment.

Even if your intentions are good, we believe you should never attempt to find vulnerabilities without permission. 
The primary goal of the WebGoat project is simple: create a de-facto interactive teaching environment for web 
application security. In the future, the project team hopes to extend WebGoat into becoming a security benchmarking 
platform and a Java-based Web site Honeypot.

## Learn in three steps

Teaching is now a first class citizen of WebGoat, we explain the vulnerability. Instead of 'just hacking' we now
focus on explaining from the beginning what for example a SQL injection is.

</p>

During the explanation of a vulnerability we build assignments which will help you understand how it works.

<h3><img src="assets/images/mitigation.png" width="8%" heigth="8%">Explain mitigation</h3>
</p>

At the end of each lesson you will receive an overview of possible mitigations which will help you during your 
development work.
